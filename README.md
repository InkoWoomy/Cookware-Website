Cookware Website

This website is a recrateion of a prototype website of a site that sells cookware, with responsiveness for tablet and mobile.

Prototype: https://www.figma.com/proto/r5mPHG6c8kRhWrrhorOL2n/CodeStack-Academy-Website?type=design&node-id=40-882&viewport=1541%2C555%2C0.26&t=Hy6Dld3nRlBmvw2B-0&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=40%3A882&show-proto-sidebar=1

Peer Review: Karen Cadavos

Laptop view: 
1. "Cookware Built to last text and container" - can be bigger to cover more of the lemons 


2. New arrivals 
	1. Fall Collection color selectors - they are all color white, I have not tried approach but have you tried changing the background color/color of the radio button itself?
	2.Nonstick Wok 14 inch - is missing the text below the header label for the wok
3. Best Sellers
	1. In fife the first column with orange stock pot is shorter than the 2 image columns with text .  See what aligns them all together and  remove that alignment particularly for the first column so it will be shorter.
	2. 1 and 3rd column "Shop now" buttons should be aligned to the bottom of the cards.
	3. Border for the cards should be slightly thinner. Try to apply 1px on the  border property in CSS. That should look closer on the figma prototype;

4.  Reviews
	1. The review hero txt should be centered on the image cards. Try using align items on the container  that holds that text box to align  it in the middle of the column.


Responsiveness: 
1. Sizing for mobile screens. Some of the elements can be smaller for mobile viewing such as logo , section headers green banner "Sale $10" to be more proportional to the screen size
2. The menu location and logo should be flipped on mobile. I believe there's a default bootstrap setting for that if you use the navbar-brand class.


Overall: 
1. I did not see a grid implementation in any of the sections. I did notice you have a class "footer-grid" but nothing on the CSS was mentioned with that class either.
2. Buttons border radius are not rounded in sigma so adjust accordingly.

Overall looks great just little tweaks that can improve closeness to the prototype. Great work Alexander!
